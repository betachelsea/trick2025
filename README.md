# ASCII Art Flower

This program was submitted to TRICK 2025 and received the "Most Natural" award.
This repository contains all the source code used to create the final `entry.rb`.

- `01_flower_description.rb`
  - The first version of the program.
  - Variable names are long and descriptive, making the code easy to understand.
  - (Note: the comment is in Japanese only.)

- `02_flower_short.rb`
  - A shortened version of the above code, created to comply with the TRICK submission rules.
  - I also added some features, such as random colors and an option to set the petal count.

- `03_asciiart.rb`
  - Formats the source code above into a flower shape.
  - Usage: `03_asciiart.rb 02_flower_short.rb > entry.rb`

- `04_entry.rb`
  - I wrote a short message in the comment section at the bottom, just for fun.
  - Final submission to TRICK 2025.

# References & Thanks

I learned most of the techniques from the book "THE WORLD OF OBFUSCATED, ESOTERIC, ARTISTIC PROGRAMMING" (あなたの知らない超絶技巧プログラミングの世界).
In particular, I referred to Chapters 2-1 and 8-1.
I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude.
